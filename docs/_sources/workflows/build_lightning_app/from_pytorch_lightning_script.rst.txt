Build app from PyTorch Lightning script
#######################################

**Audience:** Users who want to build an app from their PyTorch Lightning scripts.

----

***********************************************
Why do I want to build an app from a PL script?
***********************************************
Generating an app from a PL script allows you to immediately run on the cloud and share the progress with friends.
Once you're happy with your model, you can immediately expand beyond just model development to things like
making your own inference APIs, research demos or even speeding up your data pipeline.

The PyTorch Lightning app is your entry point to the full end-to-end ML licefycle.

----

*******************
Generate a template
*******************

To generate a template from a PyTorch Lightning script, use this command:

.. code:: bash

    lightning init pl-app path/to/the/pl_script.py


If your script is not at the root of the project folder, and you'd like to include all source files within that folder, you can specify the root path as the first argument:

.. code:: bash

    lightning init pl-app path/to/project/root path/to/the/pl_script.py


The default trainer app lets you train a model with a beautiful UI locally and on the cloud with zero effort!

----

***********
Run the app
***********
.. note:: this page is under construction

Run the app locally:

.. code:: bash

    lightning run app pl-app/app.py

Or run it on the cloud so you can share with collaborators and even use all the cloud GPUs you want

.. code:: bash

    lightning run app pl-app/app.py --cloud

*******************
Modify the template
*******************

The command above generates an app file like this:

.. note:: TODO: list the file and show how to extend it

.. code:: python

    from your_app_name import ComponentA, ComponentB

    import lightning as L


    class LitApp(L.LightningFlow):
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            super().__init__()
            self.component_a = ComponentA()
            self.component_b = ComponentB()

        def run(self):
            self.component_a.run()
            self.component_b.run()


    app = L.LightningApp(LitApp())

Now you can add your own components as you wish!

************
Known issues
************

- The UI takes a couple seconds to load when opening the app, be patient.
- The timer resets when refreshing the page.
- The UI for adding new environment variables does not provide an option to delete an entry.
- A bug exists that leaves the script hanging at the start of training when using the DDP strategy.
- DDP-spawn is not supported due to pickling issues.
- It is currently not possible to submit a new run once the script has finished or failed.
