Level 6: Publish your Lightning App
###################################
**Audience:** New users to the framework.

**Prereqs:** None.

*******************************************
What publishing Lightning Apps does for you
*******************************************
Publishing a Lightning App, allows you to share your work with the Lightning community so that others won't have
to repeat the work you've built. This is at the core of the opensource ethos, that allows us to build
on top of each other's work.

If your Lightning App is for a company, or business you are trying to monetize, publishing your Lightning App allows your users
to visit a single place where they won't have to worry about installing your Lightning App or running it on their own
accounts.

**************************
Publish your Lightning App
**************************
To publish a Lightning App, visit `lightning.ai <lightning.ai>`_, expand the "Apps & Components" menu, and hit "Submit yours".
This will take you to `this form <https://lightning-ai.typeform.com/to/J4ORMSn8?typeform-source=lightning.ai>`_.

********************************************
Guidelines for publishing your Lightning App
********************************************
Only the very best apps get accepted to the Lightning Gallery. Here are some guidelines to help you with yours.

----

Thumbnail
^^^^^^^^^
Make sure you have a high-quality Thumbnail. The image should be 300x200 and smaller than 20kb.

----

App name
^^^^^^^^
App names can only be 1-3 words at most. Names should be unique/recognizable. Remember Uber, Snapchat, etc...

----

Short Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The short description should be succinct and to the point. Avoid filler words like "this app allows you to". It should
describe what your users can do with the app NOT the tools that are being used in the app.

----

Long Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use the long description to describe to the user what the app does in more detail, and why they should use it.
This is your time to shine!

Don't use gimmiky sentences like "have you ever wanted to?", "wouldn't it be great if?". Be professional
and let the user know what value your app brings to them.

----

Tags
^^^^
Tags should allow users to know if the app is relevant for them. This is where it's helpful to let the
user know the domains (NLP, RL, CV) and even the key libraries used (PyTorch Lightning, Tensorboard, Timm, etc...).

----

Code example
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The code example should be minimal. Do not add anything the user doesn't need to know. Don't try to show
off all the features of your app or component, simply show the most minimal, critical piece of code that
can get your users started immediately.
