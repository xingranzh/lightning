Choose a Lightning App
**********************
The simplest way to get started with Lightning Apps, is to find a Lightning App similar to something you are trying
to build. Simply visit `lightning.ai <lightning.ai>`_ and find a Lightning App that is relevant to your work.

If you need inspiration, check out some of these examples:

.. raw:: html

    <div class="display-card-container">
        <div class="row">

.. Add callout items below this line

.. displayitem::
   :header: Lightning Sweeper
   :description: Use this Lightning App to run hyperparameter sweeps, or build your own version.
   :button_link: https://lightning.ai/app/8FOWcOVsdf-Lightning%20Sweeper
   :col_css: col-md-4
   :height: 200
   :tag: research workflows

.. displayitem::
   :header: InVideo search
   :description: Use this Lightning App to see a more end-to-end production workflow which can be extended with deployment strategies and more.

.. displayitem::
   :header: Unsplash Image Search
   :description: Example Lightning App if you want to build research demos.
   :button_link: https://lightning.ai/app/vIDPvY3YAA-Unsplash%20Image%20Search

.. raw:: html

        </div>
    </div>

************************
Launch the Lightning App
************************
The first thing you should try is to "launch" the Lightning App to see how a Lightning App works before you decide to dive into the code.
Some Lightning Apps cannot be launched because of the way they have been constructed, or for cost reasons for the author.

For example, here's the page for the `Unsplash image search app <https://01g5ndka6j747ta6bm9cz9xk3p.litng-ai-03.litng.ai/view/Blog>`_.

When you submit a Lightning App to the Lightning App Gallery, you can decide if a Lightning App can be launched. Otherwise, users
will have to clone & run the Lightning App to run on their accounts.

----

***********
Clone & Run
***********
If you're happy with the Lightning App you found and want to try it out, the next action should be to **clone & run** the Lightning App.
To **clone & run** go to the details page of that Lightning App and press **Clone & Run**.

For example, try the **Clone & Run** button `for this Lightning App <https://lightning.ai/app/vIDPvY3YAA-Unsplash%20Image%20Search>`_.

Clone and run starts the Lightning App on your account. If cloning and running is going to cost you money, you'll get
a prompt to verify that you want to do that.

----

**********************
Open the Lightning App
**********************
Once the Lightning App has started, press "Launch" to see the Lightning App. You can send that link to any of your colleagues so
they can also use the Lightning App.

For example, here's the page that appears for the `Unsplash Image Search Lightning App <https://01g5ndka6j747ta6bm9cz9xk3p.litng-ai-03.litng.ai/view/Blog>`_.

.. Warning:: Remember, that if the Lightning App performs expensive actions, such as training a model, and you share with people,
   they might accidentally incur costs on your account. Make sure this is what you are expecting.

----

*****************
Download the code
*****************
Now that you verified that the Lightning App does indeed work end-to-end, go to the **Code** tab and click "Download zip", to get the full code
on your machine.
