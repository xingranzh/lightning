Level 5: Share your Lightning Apps
##################################
**Audience:** Users who work in teams.

**Prereqs:** You've ran a Lightning App locally and the cloud.

****************************************
What sharing Lightning Apps does for you
****************************************
When working on teams or to show your Lightning App to your users or collaborators, it's often
helpful to share a link to your Lightning App.

Sharing a link to your Lightning App, allows your collaborators to see what you've built, instead of them having
to clone, install the repo, and very likely not get anything running.

----

************************
Share your Lightning App
************************
The easiest way to share your Lightning Apps is to run them on Lightning Cloud:

.. code:: bash

    lightning run app app.py --cloud

Once your Lightning App starts running, press "Open", then copy the link from the browser and share the link with your
colleagues!
